# CC-Ubuntu14.04

Subsumed by [CC-Ubuntu16.04](https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/CC-Ubuntu16.04)
(which also builds 14.04 Trusty images). The scripts there inspect
`DIB_RELEASE` if it's `trusty` or `xenial` then do different things if this or
that need to be installed/configured for one or the other.
